# Testing

How the suites are structured, what's covered, the biggest gap, and how to shore
it up. Companion: [known-gaps-and-hardening.md](known-gaps-and-hardening.md).

## Layers

| Layer | Where | Runs | Covers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rust unit | `#[cfg(test)]` in `src/*.rs` | `cargo test` | pure helpers: enums, `charge_matches`, `decimal_to_cents`, `dollars`, CSRF token compare, signature verifiers, hashing, ETA/tracking, ship-method math |
| Rust integration | `tests/integration.rs` | `cargo test` | drives the real `router()` in **degraded mode** (`AppState::new(None, …)` — no DB): routing, CSRF branches, security headers, rate limiting, host allowlist, `/ws` anon-reject |
| Rust DB-backed | `tests/*_db.rs`, `#[ignore]` | `DATABASE_URL=... cargo test -- --ignored` | the money/stock paths a degraded run can't reach; **wired into the e2e CI job** which has a Postgres |
| Browser E2E | `e2e/*.test.mjs`, `node:test` | `cd e2e && npm test` | the real app in Chrome under **both Playwright and Puppeteer** |
| Cluster smoke | `e2e/cluster/run-cluster.mjs` | opt-in CronJob | live storefront scenarios via `dd-browser-test-server` (both engines) |

## The big gap: DB-mutation coverage

Historically **every** Rust test ran degraded or against pure helpers — *no* test
exercised a real DB mutation (`place_order`, `ensure_hold`, `settle_order`,
webhook dedup, the recurring runner). The browser E2E covers the user-facing
flows against the real DB, and `tests/recurring_runner_db.rs` is the first
Rust DB-backed test. **New money/stock logic should get a DB-backed test.**

### Adding a DB-backed test (the pattern)

`tests/recurring_runner_db.rs` is the template:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
#[ignore] // needs a real DATABASE_URL; run with --ignored
async fn my_invariant() {
    let conn = db::build_pool(&std::env::var("DATABASE_URL").unwrap()).await.unwrap();
    // seed with sea_orm::Statement raw SQL, call the db:: fn, assert via SELECT,
    // then DELETE your rows (use a fresh Uuid namespace so parallel runs don't collide).
}
```

- `#[ignore]` keeps them out of the default `cargo test` (which has no DB).
- The **e2e CI workflow** (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) runs them with
  `cargo test --test <name> -- --ignored` against its throwaway Postgres after
  the declarative schema has been applied. Add each new `*_db.rs` there.
- Migrations only need Supabase's `auth.uid()` stubbed (the workflow does this);
  everything else is vanilla Postgres.

## Running the suites

```sh
# Rust (degraded — no DB, no network):
cargo test

# Rust DB-backed (against a real DB):
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… cargo test --test recurring_runner_db -- --ignored --nocapture

# Browser E2E, one engine, against a locally-booted app on :8145:
#   export SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (for authed suites) and
#   ATHLETO_OPERATIONS_API_KEY / E2E_OPS_KEY (for the ops-approval test)
cd e2e && npm install
E2E_ENGINE=playwright node --test --test-timeout=60000 --test-concurrency=1 *.test.mjs
E2E_ENGINE=puppeteer  node --test --test-timeout=60000 --test-concurrency=1 *.test.mjs
npm test          # both engines

# Cluster live smoke (needs dd-browser-test-server healthy):
BROWSER_TEST_URL=… SERVER_AUTH_SECRET=… node e2e/cluster/run-cluster.mjs
```

The browser harness (`e2e/lib/`) drives one shared driver interface across both
engines, logs in hermetically (Supabase admin magic-link + a self-set
`athleto_login_flow` cookie — no email send), and has an RFC-6238 `totp()`.
Auth-dependent suites self-skip when `SUPABASE_*` is unset, so CI stays green
without secrets and richer with them. `E2E_SKIP_LIVE=1` skips the biz-host check
that hits the deployed site.

## Highest-value missing tests (ranked)

All DB-bound; add as `tests/*_db.rs` (see the pattern above).

1. **`db::record_payment_event` — webhook replay dedup.** Same `(provider,
   event_id)` inserted twice → `true` then `false`. This is the *entire* replay
   guarantee.
2. **`payments::settle_order` — amount / provider / idempotency.** (a) `charged`
   ≠ `total_cents` → order stays unpaid, no ledger post; (b) provider ≠ the
   order's initiated provider → no-op; (c) settling twice with the same
   `provider_ref` → `Paid` once, ledger posted once.
3. **`db::place_order` — stock decrement & oversell.** (a) `on_hand` drops by
   qty; (b) a hold in another cart reduces availability → `Insufficient`;
   (c) two concurrent `place_order` on one product don't oversell (the
   `FOR UPDATE`); (d) the cart's holds + items are cleared on success.
4. **`db::ensure_hold` — cross-cart availability & lazy expiry.** (a) a live hold
   in another cart exhausting stock → `Insufficient`; (b) an *expired* hold
   doesn't block; (c) re-holding the same cart+product upserts (not stacks) qty.
5. **`/ws` cross-user isolation.** Two authenticated connections; broadcasting
   user B's `cart_id` must **not** push to A. Only the anon-reject is tested
   today (`integration.rs`). Needs an authenticated-ws harness.
6. **`db::run_due_recurring_orders` — due-selection & double-fire.** Partly
   covered by `recurring_runner_db.rs` (provider guard); still want: exactly one
   child + cursor advance for an owned order, none for cancelled/NULL cursor,
   and one-child-not-two under concurrency (the advisory lock).
7. **`security::apply` — untested CSRF branches.** Header-token *mismatch* (only
   form-field mismatch is tested) and the `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` branch; plus
   `Config::is_biz_host` rejecting a spoofed `biz.`-looking Host.
8. **`db::set_order_payment_status` — `paid_at` idempotency.** First `Paid`
   stamps `paid_at`; a replayed `Paid` must not move it.
9. **`db::record_fulfillment` — status advance & scoping.** Correct ETA window,
   flips order to `fulfilled`, `None` for an unknown order.
10. **`payments::stripe_webhook` end-to-end replay.** A signed
    `checkout.session.completed` settles once; the identical event replayed
    returns 200 with no re-settle and no second ledger post (ties #1+#2 at the
    handler boundary).

**Already well covered — don't re-add:** signature verification incl. replay
window (all three providers), CSRF missing/mismatched/partial + security headers
+ nonce freshness + rate limiting, `host_allowed`, and the browser flows
(storefront/cart/holds/checkout/receipt/tracking/reorder/2FA-setup/B2B-approval/
payment-status).
